## Prosper Loan Data

> This is an exploratory data analysis of the loan data from Prosper.
Prosper runs a website where individuals can either invest in personal loans or request to borrow money.

> The Prosper Loan data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

> This analysis is to help understand factors that determine the Prsoper loan’s outcome status and borrower's rate.


## Summary of Findings

> Most of the borrowers had average ratings with normal distribution.

> For the loan status variable, it can be seen from the pie chart that most of the loans are currently running, followed closely by loans which have been completed. The loan status looks good as not a lot of the loans defaulted or needed to be charged off. Would investigate more as we go an as to the major factors that influence a loan's outcome

>The income range as seen using a bar chart seems to be evenly distributed with most of the borroers earning between' 25,000−𝑡𝑜 74,999'

>A huge portion of the borrowers are employed, be it self employment, part time employment or full time,

>The employment status seems to have a negative corelation with the borrower rate. From the plots above we can deduce that borrowers who are not employed and others have higher rates.

>It would seem that borrowers that aren't home owners are more likely to default

## Key Insights for Presentation
> At a glance, we can see the what the borrowers earn and what range they fall into

>It is expected that high income enables you achieve financial freedom and so the high income earners should be home owners. 
The plot shows us that a lot of high income earners are actually not home owners as one might expect

>
The outcome of the loan status is significantly influenced by the borrower's rate and duration of the loan. Loans with longer term and high rates have a higher chance of going bad

>The relationship between the borrower's rate and prosper rating is very strong. Prosper's rating is a very great determinant to the borrower's rate. Borrower's with good credit rates get lower rates while customers with bad credit rates get higher rates as their risk is higher.

>The outcome of the loan status is significantly influenced by the borrower's rate and duration of the loan. 
Loans with longer term and high rates have a higher chance of going bad
